        This app was created using Mongodb Stitch, a HIPAA certified backend 
        service. This means all of the data you give and see on this app 
        is all secure. You doctor will also be able to see your data. 
        Muse Direct (the app to record a session) on the other hand, is not 
        HIPAA certified. This means that this app would not be usable in a 
        professional environment. Currently Muse has not made it possible to 
        get the data in a way that is HIPAA certified but a new SDK is being 
        developed and will soon give us the opportunity to develop a HIPAA 
        certified method for transmitting sleep data.
